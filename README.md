* Website name: Your Pokedex
* Link: TBD

* Site Description: My website is basically a beginners guide to Pokemon.  It is a way to introduce those who may be new to Pokemon to all of the various types and attacks.
Someone can create their own user, and will be able to learn about each Pokemon whether it's reading the Pokedex, or inserting their username into my random Pokemon
and attack generator.  I made my site very simple to use so it can be used by basically anyone.

* Features
  - Full Pokedex:  I was able to use the Pokemon API in order to allow the user to access all the Pokemon available.  The Pokemon are listed in order so the user has a chance
    to kind of go through the history of Pokemon.

  - User ability and random generator: I was able to make a user-oriented game out of the PokeAPI and my own user database.  While it's not necessary to become a signed-up
    user on the site, I wanted to find a way to make things more engaging for a user.  So I added the ability to make a username, and use that name to pair the user with
    a random Pokemon and have the Pokemon use a attack.  This teaches the user about Pokemon and attacks at the same time, because I also added "attack" pages to eductate users
    further. Each Pokemon and each attack have the background of their page as the "type" they are.  A "psychic" Pokemon will have a psychic backgound.  A "Dragon" attack
    will have a dragon background.  Also, on each attack page, I have a description of the attack so the user is able to distinguish each attack from one another with a sentence
    or two.

* Tests
  - Tests are run through the "npm test" command  
 
* User Flow
  - At the home page, there's basically two paths to take: one being just looking through the Pokedex, and the other is signing up/logging in so they can play around
    with different types of Pokemon and Attacks.  The Pokedex route is just for people looking for quick descriptions of Pokemon.  It's less engaging, but was made more
    for those who want a simple quick answer to a Pokemon question.  The other route is the one I feel like more people would use, and that is the login/signup random
    generator game.  This will allow users to discover Pokemon and Attacks more quickly and give them quick information on each.

* This site was built using React.js (frontend) and Node.js (backend).

* Final Thoughts: Even though this app is fairly simple, I still put a lot of work into it and I'm proud of how it came out.
